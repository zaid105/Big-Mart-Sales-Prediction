# Big-Mart-Sales-Prediction
# Problem Description
<br>
The data scientists at BigMart have collected 2013 sales data for 1559 products across 10 stores in different cities. Also, certain attributes of each product and store have been defined.
<br><br>
The aim is to build a predictive model and find out the sales of each product at a particular store. Using this model, BigMart will try to understand the properties of products and stores which play a key role in increasing sales.<br><br>

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Detailed exploration of the dataset to understand distributions, correlations, and patterns.
- **Feature Engineering:** Creation of new features or transformations to enhance model performance.
- **Sales Prediction Model:** Building machine learning models to predict sales based on relevant features.
- **Data Visualization:** Visual representations of key insights and trends using charts and graphs.
- **Hypothesis Testing**: To test the null
